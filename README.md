## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

With this challenge I have learned how to place several images in the same container and how to position them. 

The code is this:


```css
background-color: var(--darkCyan);
background-image:
  url(../images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
  url(../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
background-position:
  top -50vh right 50vw,
  top 50vh left 50vw;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
```

### Continued development

I need to improve on how to approach the project when naming the classes and structuring the html. I also need to work on breakpoints and responsive design.
